            39 years ago, in 1981, a Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto created the soon-to-be momumental
            fictional character — Mario. Acting as the Nintendo's mascot, as well as being the eponymous protagonist of
            the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games and became one of the most recognized and loved game
            characters ever created.

            At first Mario was known as Jumpman in the Donkey Kong game, released in 1981. He was renamed Mario later in
            1982.

            In 1985, Super Mario Bros. video game, the successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros. and the first in
            the Super Mario series of platformers, was developed and published by Nintendo in Japan for the Family
            Computer (Famicom). It was released later that year in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System
            (NES).

            In Super Mario Bros. Mario saves Princess Toadstool (later known as Princess Peach) of the Mushroom Kingdom
            from King Koopa (later known as Bowser). To save the princess, Mario must conquer the eight worlds of the
            Mushroom Kingdom by going to the castle in each in order to defeat a minion of King Koopa.

                The success of Super Mario Bros. led to the development of many successors in the Super Mario series of
                video games. Two of these sequels, Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3, had similar levels of
                commercial success. The gameplay concepts and elements established in Super Mario Bros. are prevalent in
                nearly every Super Mario game. It helped to popularize side-scrolling platform games.

                The original version of the Super Mario Bros. game has sold more than 40 million copies, making it the
                bestselling video game in the Mario series and one of the bestselling video games of all time, with 29
                million copies sold in North America. In 1990, a study taken in North America suggested that more
                children in the United States were familiar with Mario than they were with Mickey Mouse.
                electronic platform game, electronic game genre characterized by maneuvering a character from platform to platform by jumping, climbing, and swinging in order to reach some final destination. The first genuine platform game was Nintendo Company Ltd.’s Donkey Kong (1981), an arcade game in which Jumpman climbed up and down ladders and jumped from platform to platform while eluding a giant ape (Donkey Kong) on his way to rescuing a woman. Jumpman, now renamed Mario and joined by his brother Luigi, returned as the star of Mario Bros. (1983), a two-player cooperative arcade game that was subsequently released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES; 1983) home video console. A vastly improved version for the NES, Super Mario Bros. (1985), sold more than 40 million copies, making it the best-selling video game of all time according to the Guinness Book of World Records. It also was the first video game to be made into a movie, Super Mario Bros. (1993) starring Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper.
                Decades later, and Super Mario Bros. holds up as well today. In fact, Gamers are still discovering its
                secrets, and thanks to plenty of ports, it continues to charm new generations of kids. In the original
                Super Mario Bros., solo players pilot Mario, and an additional player can play as Luigi. The game is
                based on a series of side-scrolling levels, each filled with enemies ranging from mushroomlike Goombas
                to evil turtles known as Koopa Troopas. The levels take place in different settings, some in dungeons
                and some above ground, with fights against Bowser impersonators at the end of castle levels. Once the
                imposter is defeated, a Mushroom Kingdom resident informs Mario or Luigi that the princess is in another
                castle.The NES eventually faded from the spotlight as new 16-bit consoles were created, such as the Sega Genesis and Nintendo’s own Super Nintendo Entertainment System. However, games were still released for the NES into the 1990s, until licensed production on a library of more than 1,000 titles ceased in 1994. The NES, though less technologically advanced than newer consoles, remained a popular choice for “retro” gamers into the 21st century.  The game is completed with the defeat of the true Bowser and the rescue of Princess Toadstool
